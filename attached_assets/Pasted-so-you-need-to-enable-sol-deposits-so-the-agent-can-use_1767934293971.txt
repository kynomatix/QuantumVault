so you need to enable sol deposits so the agent can use sol for gas.

The agent will need sol for creating token accoutns etc too so 100% SOL deposits are needed, and then the concern here is that we may have been using a better method before but now that you've gone through and changed everything several times to try and get it working but the whole reason why it wasn't working is because insufficient gas potentially so I suppose if the gas is then maybe we'll have to go back and use the optimum or the most preferable or best method again to be able to add or remove funds but give me the ability to deposit Solana so I can add testnet Also when you create a new drift account they require a Solana deposit as well I don't know how much it is you'll have to look it up but when a user connects for the first time they'll need to deposit enough so for that fee that set up fee it's not really a fee but they'll need to do that I guess I just feel and then also a small amount for gas S can you workout how much is required both to cover the bit needed for gas like probably point 3. or something like that Maybe 3. soil or 1. and umm the amount required from Drift to set up an account for the first time as well Like that should be done automatically when a user connects for the first time but because I'm not connecting for the first time you'll need to set that up forming now I'll deposit and you'll need to just go and manually for me and then I'll test it later with another wallet to make sure when the user opens or connects to the platform for the first time that it gives a little welcome message and asks for the necessary amount of solana required for both drift account set it should happen Right. then and there and the cover the rent for the USDC account and other token accounts'cause that's how it works on salon and Justice having solved the Solana there for general trading I mean drift is pretty low in terms of it's like almost gas less but I don't think it will be for us So yeah that's necessary so that'll you'll have to put that sole on a deposit into the wallet section and then that will have to reflect in the total equity as well Umm you also put total equity 1100. USD C that's not what I asked you to do Total equity is 1. hundred dollars or whatever it is in dollars Total equity includ asset value as well So you really need to remove that USDC from the sidebar there so please go and have a to say what the minimum Solana deposit will need to be for a user umm to be able to use the platform And then we have to implement as well So can you turn this into a full task list Remember sure this is testnet at the moment This infrastructure needs to be built out for main OK just because it works and testing it just means shit I don't want to have to go and change heaps of stuff when we go to mainnet so we need to treat this like it is mainnet
