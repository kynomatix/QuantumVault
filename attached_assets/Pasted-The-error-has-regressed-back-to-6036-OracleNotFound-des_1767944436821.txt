The error has regressed back to 6036 (OracleNotFound), despite the oracle address matching the on-chain spot market account. This suggests the issue is with how the oracle is being handled or parsed in the deposit instruction.

## Likely Cause
- The oracle (9VCioxmni2gDLv11qufWzT3RDERhQE4iY5G7NTfYyAV) is configured as a Pyth Lazer stable coin oracle in the spot market.
- Pyth Lazer oracles may not be fully supported in manual transaction building, or the account data/parsing might be failing (e.g., incorrect owner program, invalid data structure, or incompatibility with the current Drift program version).
- The instruction expects a standard Pyth pull oracle for validation, but the Lazer oracle isn't loading correctly into the oracle map.

## Fix: Use the Pyth Pull Oracle Instead
Temporarily switch to the standard Pyth pull oracle for USDC on mainnet. This should allow the deposit to proceed while preserving the spot market's Lazer configuration (since the instruction validates against the passed oracle, not necessarily the stored one—though ideally they match).

Update `server/drift-service.ts`:
```typescript
// Temporarily use the pull oracle
const DRIFT_MAINNET_USDC_ORACLE = new PublicKey('Gnt27xtC473ZT2Mw5u8wZ68Z3gULkSTb5DuxJy7eJotD');
```

Test the deposit again. If successful, this confirms the Lazer oracle is the blocker.

## Long-Term Resolution
- **Investigate Lazer Oracle**: Check the account owner and data via Solana explorer (e.g., `solana account 9VCioxmni2gDLv11qufWzT3RDERhQE4iY5G7NTfYyAV --output json`). Ensure it's owned by the correct Pyth Lazer program and the data is valid.
- **SDK Update**: If the pull oracle works, update the SDK constants or Drift program to support Lazer oracles properly.
- **Alternative**: If possible, modify the spot market oracle to the pull address (requires admin privileges, not feasible here).

If the pull oracle doesn't work or you encounter new errors, provide the transaction signature or full logs for deeper analysis. Consider testing on devnet with the devnet oracle first.
