yeah we should make an MD document for the plan we'll just call it QVC plan and add any of these ideas to that Right. so can you add that little block there that you just mentioned Because again we need to get the fundamentals working first but then we'll come back to adding these more advanced features .

we need to make sure that there is some ability to add or remove funds manually from a Part 2. So we need to make sure that people go to the My Bots section They can add or remove equity or collateral whatever term we want to use capital I think capital is probably better maybe Or equity yeah let's go with equity Wait what's the best word can you choose. But yeah we will not be able to add or remove manually because obviously agent will be able to do that for at least managing the at the moment I can't see anywhere to add or remove equity or whatever term we decide to go with to the bot so I can see a active bot which I don't know why but it took a while to show up which is not ideal but it says there's no clutter or no money allocated to it but actually there's $100 in there so I don't really know what's going on there to be honest It's it's a legacy board we need to get rid of it basically and I want to delete it and I want my friends back I don't really I don't care that much about it's a 100 USDC testnet but I would like to make sure that when a user deletes their bots that the funds are automatically withdrawn and they don't just nuke into like the abyss I think also will probably need make sure that there's some sort of back end cleanup as well So for example when a new sub account is created for a bot I think That they'll over time accum useless sort of junk sub accounts which is abstracted from the user anyway but I think that maybe part of the delete flow when a user deletes a button it probably should also delete the sub account to keep things tidy Or is that not smart because it means that they won't be able to go and cheque the performance history because the performance history on that was tied to that sub account and we just deal with sub accounts I mean the user won't say the sub accounts anyway so maybe it doesn't matter What do you think about that
