yeah so with regards to the security note that you noted above we definitely need wallet signature verification for when they first connect because this is managing user funds so security is quite important, For the old Quantum Vault I implemented this really over the top encryption system basically where the wallet would the wallet signature was used for key authentication Because in the database obviously we probably would want to encrypt the data so that we can't see what's in there but only the user can see it because I guess we do have a database II suppose not to for the system to function I think correctly we we have a database I think i'm not sure if we do but it's important that the only person that can read that data is the user Right. or the owner of the wallet rather I should say since the agent wallet is mainly what's being used to trade the user's wallet becomes more of a deposit or withdrawal from agent wallet with their own funds and also key authentication but I don't know maybe I over complicated it last time because I had like key export key import all this dumb shit I think that just probably heard a lot of technical debt and overhead So I think just a simplified version of that would probably be fine as long as it has some level of encryption So the only person that can read from that database is the owner of the wallet isn't Does that make that make sense. deposits were working before so I assume they're probably still working now I was able to deposit 100 USD see which means you got the token account creation working which is bloody brilliant Fucking legend absolute legend You are you've absolutely nailed that so I really appreciate that and that excites me greatly So because the USDC deposits are working I assume that all other SPL token deposits will work also when that's eventually rolled out which again is great Probably don't have to worry about that on the dev net though but now that I know the deposits work we can actually probably look at building this because that was my main apprehension before in properly building this out I just really wanted to test to see if we could get SPL token deposits working with deposits umm I think the next big thing to get working is to make sure the webhook and everything's working So I'll have to a bot I suppose once you've this work I will create a new bot I suppose to make sure that the current system is functioning correctly
