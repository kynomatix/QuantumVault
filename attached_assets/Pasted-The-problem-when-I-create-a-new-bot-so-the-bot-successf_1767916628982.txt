The problem when I create a new bot so the bot successfully created screen that pops I have to scroll across umm on the screen that pops up it's not really intuitive 'cause I can't have to scroll across to get to the copy button which is dumb and you can't even see all the text and it means you have to like scroll across to all the text OU I just don't think that that's a good idea and is there any way Also it is part of the flow when creating a new bot I mentioned the importance of being able to fund the bot within the same flow so be that pop up I think that once you've successfully created a bot you can add funds to it from from there So you can add the funds from the agent wallet into that bot and as part of that flow it needs to create the sub account in Drift and all that sort of stuff Yeah but the intuitive thing to do which pinex doesn't do and I think that's stupid to be honest but is when you've successfully created the bot the Webhk and all that sort of stuff is all successfully created You can fund it straight from within that pop up I think that's important and way more intuitive than however Pionex does it which is stupid Cos you've got to go You got to Close. the box and you got to go and find the signal bot and then you got to like add funds to it and select like the ticker like it's stupid I think I think it's kind of dumb to be honest This is not the way I like to work anyway see ya I think that this flow is better and I think that we need to be able to add capital. also I can't see anywhere to add USDC to the Agent Wallet I can't see a deposit button anyway and you can you go and Delete that. old legacy bot 'cause we don't need that like we don't want this Legacy bought shit to come up with so just remove all the old Legacy bots please and only keep there's just 1. but just keep the 1. that's new We don't need the old 1. clogging up the would I'll just take the hit on the USDC I couldn't not delete it for some reason the delete button didn't work So yeah I couldn't delete it the old legacy button So we all have to cheque the the delete button works too
