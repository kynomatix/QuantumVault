So the way that I want this to work and I understand that Drift has its own account as well Right. so Drift has an account that it creates on the back end I believe and yeah but I want the agent to have a wallet as well I think this is 1. in the past I had like a withdrawal like a seed phrase show seed phrase and stuff like that so that people back up the agent wall wallet so I probably really should have fucking hell I really should have done this before and told you the full structure because I feel like maybe you might not really what I'm trying to do here So the way this platform works is this is AAI agent platform Right. so it's bot trading yes but also I will be adding agentic features AI agentic features into it Right. which means that the agent needs a wallet Right. it needs its own wallet and that the agent manages that the funds there as I said before because it'll be able to do other things with those funds in the future So it will deposit funds into Drift and Drift will have its own I think account tied to the agent wallet the reason why the agent has its own wallet and this is typical with bot platforms because it will I'm pretty sure this is how it already works Right. there's an account wallet or is that the drift account Because if it's just the drift account maybe we can use the drift account wallet I suppose and that's just like the primary place where the funds are parked But in the future when I have Defi strateg automation when the agent would need to deposit would need to withdraw from the drift wallet But then where is it going to go Right. have to hold the funds somewhere and this particular wallet is the user wallet Right. the 1. I'm connected to is the user wallet which again is just used authentication and withdrawing and depositing So a lot of these platforms like there's other there's like solana platforms that it like use a gentec sort of trading mechanisms as in when I say Argentic I mean like it's just basic like agent based functions like buying and selling without needing a clicker pop up But you know you deposit from your wallet into the platform wallet and then that way the agent can perform actions without requiring user additional user interaction just to make it feel more streamlined If you want to do sort of advanced automated functionality especially with AI agents and stuff like that You'll your own like the agent will need its own wallet I don't know if it's good enough that it just goes into drift What do you think can let's let's discuss this and I think you know obviously then if we if the agent has its own wallet then the user will will need a way to recover that if for some reason they lose access to the platform or something goes wrong They'll need to be able to get their seed phrase for the agent wallet so they can restore it to their device But I'm not sure Do you think it's good enough it's OK that it's drift what if there's a problem with drift in the future You know he's like attacked or something means that if we're using drift as the custodian for funds then that would be lost'cause I deal with this would be like you know excess profits are withdrawn into the agent wallet so that that way they can be added other strategies on the plus side of it staying in drift then it also earns yield because drift just from depositing into drift they earn yield like sometimes up to 10. percent when it's super busy So there's pros to leaving the funds in DRIFT But then if we want to add additional strategies and stuff in the future then it needs to be able to withdraw to its own agent bullet
