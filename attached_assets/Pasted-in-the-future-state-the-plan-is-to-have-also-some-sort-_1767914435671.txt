in the future state the plan is to have also some sort of automatic defy deployment where essentially it's like Lulu LULO and it goes around and finds the best rates and deposits or it can add funds to various D5. strategies that we can create so it's important to have some like threshold setting as well so that you know if a bot's been making this amount of profit it doesn't really need to hold onto that equity or collateral yeah I'd say equity the USDC profit from that they could have a certain threshold that where like if they earned a certain amount of profit it it can automatically withdraw back to the agent will That way the agent wallet can go and deploy those funds into these other DeFi strategies'cause there'll be things like for example the neutral strategies or like other potential strategies that drift has that way there's USDC can also earn more on top of it so for example like the JP strategy or something like that but I didn't want at this yet because I wanna get the core functionality working first and then we can work on that but the reason why it's important that main account collateral is set up and you know bots individually get their own capital is because we want to have that automatic withdrawal system and in the future state there will also be a sole card The soul card is a like a debit card for crypt and you know like I'll see if I I'll have to probably ask the team for some sort of API or something for collaboration but I mean obviously it's future state but that'll be another thing Right. so basically the bots the agents will have to automatically be able to add collateral or remove or have the option for collateral to be added or removed because say for example a bot is at risk of liquidation then the system should be smart enough to automatically add more collateral Right. this would be an option to turn on or off for a full Agent autom because the problem with pioneer is if for example you get and I just think that this is really bad UX if this the ability for this is a full agent AI agent you could say based decentralised trading platform Right. So the idea with that is that the agent is smart enough to know that if a trade is at risk of being liquidated then if there is a pool of capital that it can use or it can deposit into a bot then it should be able to do it automatically and that's why we need like solid functionality and understanding of how the funds and allocation works and we need to make sure that the is smart enough to be able to order deposit or order withdraw collateral 2. strategies umm because some people would just probably let a strategy like liquidate without caring 'cause if it's like obviously if it's not working probably it's best to just for it to die I guess but maybe it's just in in the middle of a drawdown. And it will eventually work but so in those circumstances then if they don't see the alert or if they don't know that they're about to get rekt then it means they just get get liquidated and it's like it feels like this is just really outdated approach when we have AI agents and all sorts of really sophisticated things out there that can help people protect themselves
